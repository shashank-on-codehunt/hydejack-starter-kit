0. this unordered seed list will be replaced by toc as unordered list
{:toc}

If you want one line code go [here](#finalCode)

## Pre-Requisites

- Basic understanding on docker especially about Images  and Containers
- sql CRUD commands
- docker installed  on your system

NOTE : in case you want to jump straight to the code here 

### Pull the Image from Docker Hub

First get the Image from docker hub 

```bash
docker pull mysql/mysql-server:latest
```

Now Check whether the Image is available , and the response would be similar to one given below 

```bash
docker images
```

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dockerMySql/Untitled.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dockerMySql/Untitled.png)

## Deploy the Image

Run the following command , here 

- -d : means  to run image as service
- 'latest' tag can be replaced with the custom as well (in case you  want to install some other version)
- [container_name] : this is custom name that you want to provide

```bash
docker run --name=[container_name] -d mysql/mysql-server:latest
```

Check the status of docker image whether its running with following command 

```bash
docker ps
```

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dockerMySql/Untitled%201.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dockerMySql/Untitled%201.png)

## Connect to MySql

Make sure the mysql client is present (for linux)

```bash
apt-get install mysql-client
```

to start mysql client inside container use following command 

```bash
docker exec -it [container_name] mysql -uroot -p
```

this will prompt password 

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dockerMySql/Untitled%202.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dockerMySql/Untitled%202.png)

To get the password , as we have not manually provided , we need to refer to the mysql logs , hence type following command and it will show GENERATED ROOT PASSWORD as shown below 

```bash
docker logs [container_name]
```

![{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dockerMySql/Untitled%203.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dockerMySql/Untitled%203.png)

this will open sql window , now we should not want to use Auto Generated mysql and trigger our own password 

```bash
mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '[newpassword]';
```

## Storage

By default docker would be storing all Information inside the docker container 

To make it available in host system 

<a id="finalCode"></a>
```bash
docker run --name <Custom_container_name> -v <host_directory_address>:<docker_directory_to_host> -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<custom_Password> -d mysql:latest
```

hence one example would be (assuming D:\mySqlData folder is present)

```bash
docker run --name mysql-v3 -v D:\mySqlData:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mypass -d mysql:latest
```

## Operation on Docker

basic operation are to start, stop and restart container 

```bash
docker start [container_name]
docker stop [container_name]
docker restart [container_name]
```

# Conclusion

Now for mostly your local development one can directly connect to this docker.

After following all above steps you  should have been able to successfully connect and deploy a Mysql container 

Do Reach out  in comment section in case you are facing some issue in any of the steps
